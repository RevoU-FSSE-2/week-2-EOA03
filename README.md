#Welcome to my assignment

##Introduction

This assignment was made based on what I liked. I made this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
There're many problem before this website is deployed.
First, I stuck to the validation of the form. When I made the validation, the pop-up window didn't come out. And finally I can solve it.
Second, I stuck to the grid of the image. When I had already made the grid, I met a problem again. The image don't want to be in the center. I had to search for many examples to solve the problem.
And the last one is the responsiveness of the website. I have made the website that can be reached by using another device beside a PC or laptop.
Finally, all the problems were already solved and the website was deployed using Netlify.
